This is the source code for Curator, an open-source meta-album
generator.

History
=======

When I got married I crowd-sourced the photography for my wedding.
However typically this gives you a large number of desperate wedding
albums hosted on various photo sharing sites and of varying quality.

I wrote this tool as a way of creating a new album from a selection of
the pictures posted by my friends. It's intended to be meta-data
friendly (using exif data) so a nicely formatted "official" album can
be made from these multiple sources while keeping decent attribution
and link-backs to the original source.
